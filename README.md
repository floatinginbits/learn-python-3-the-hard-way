# Goal #

Every exercise highlights some aspect of using Python for programming. This practice is used to recollect important details one must remember when programming in Python.

# Learnings #

## Ex 01 ##

- '#' is also called an octothorpe
- Feels great to code in vim again

## Ex 02 ##

- Comments can be start of line or after code in a line
- Reading text backwards is a handy trick for comparison

## Ex 03 ##

- PEMDAS used for evaluation of mathematical ops in Python
- M&D (multiplication and division) happen simultaneously, from left to right
- Same is true for A&S
- '//' is integer division; '%' is modulus operation
- '**' is exponentiation operator; associativity is right to left

## Ex 04 ##

- Python being a snake, recommends to use snake case naming convention
- Python has dynamic typing, using only variable assignment and no variable declaration

## Ex 05 ##

- String can be created using ' or " ; no convention, so just be consistent in usage
- There are no characters in Python, only strings
- Use ' or " smartly to avoid using escape characters in a string
- Any string can be converted to f-string by adding 'f' at start of string!

## Ex 06 ##

- One can insert string within string using f-string variables!
- Strings are objects, allowing us to use methods like format
- '+' can concatenate strings due to operator overloading

## Ex 07 ##

- '*' can be used to concatenate given string multiple times

## Ex 08 ##

- format() ignores extra parameters; complains if given less parameters
- format() does require explicit string conversion for input parameters

## Ex 09 ##

- Multiline string can be created using ' or "
- '\' is used for escape sequences in strings

## Ex 10 ##

- Python uses UTF-8 as default source encoding
- '\n' (Line feed) is newline convention for Unix systems, which is different from Windows
- Some interesting escape sequences:
    * '\a' : Bell
    * '\b' : Backsapce
    * '\r' : Carriage return
    * '\f' : Form feed
    * '\t' : Horizontal tab
    * '\v' : Vertical Tab

## Ex 11 ##

- Use input() as an interactive way to get input
- input() also takes prompt message

## Ex 12 ##

- pydoc is great for reading documentation

## Ex 13 ##

- Multiple variables are initialized by unpacking an iterable
- Command-line arguments are another way of input

## Ex 14 ##

- f-strings can also be created from multiline strings!

## Ex 15 ##

- open() creates a stream object
- Remember to call close() method for stream objects once done

## Ex 16 ##

- mode flag for open() dictates stream behaviour
- '+' modifier for mode flag is interesting

## Ex 17 ##

- Use ';' to have multiple statement in single line
- Python can automatically take care of closing files at times

## Ex 18 ##

- Function can be given positional or keyword arguments
- Structured programming in Python happens with indentation
- Unicode letters can be used for identifiers, but best to avoid it

## Ex 19 ##

- Functions can take expressions as inputs

## Ex 20 ##

- seek() has a whence parameter, which determines start position for seek
- readline() doesn't strip newline but input() does

## Ex 21 ##

- 'return' keyword allows evaluation of a function functional!

## Ex 22 ##

## Ex 23 ##

- Decode bytes, encode strings

## Ex 29 ##

- Remember not to nest too deep with if

## Ex 30 ##

- Else is not necessary; it works as a catchall scenario

## Ex 31 ##

- Combining interactive input with conditionals make powerful programs

## Ex 32 ##

- For loops have a variable declaration without explicit assignment!

## Ex 33 ##

- While loops can be rewritten as for loops

## Ex 34 ##
