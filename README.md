# Goal #

Every exercise highlights some aspect of using Python for programming. This practice is used to recollect important details one must remember when programming in Python.

# Learnings #

## Ex 01 ##

- '#' is also called an octothorpe
- Feels great to code in vim again

## Ex 02 ##

- Comments can be start of line or after code in a line
- Reading text backwards is a handy trick for comparison

## Ex 03 ##

- PEMDAS used for evaluation of mathematical ops in Python
- M&D (multiplication and division) happen simultaneously, from left to right
- Same is true for A&S
- '//' is integer division; '%' is modulus operation
- '**' is exponentiation operator; associativity is right to left

## Ex 04 ##

- Python being a snake, recommends to use snake case naming convention
- Python has dynamic typing, using only variable assignment and no variable declaration

## Ex 05 ##

- String can be created using ' or " ; no convention, so just be consistent in usage
- There are no characters in Python, only strings
- Use ' or " smartly to avoid using escape characters in a string
- Any string can be converted to f-string by adding 'f' at start of string!

## Ex 06 ##

- One can insert string within string using f-string variables!
- Strings are objects, allowing us to use methods like format
- '+' can concatenate strings due to operator overloading

## Ex 07 ##

- '*' can be used to concatenate given string multiple times

## Ex 08 ##

- format method ignores extra parameters; complains if given less parameters
- format method does require explicit string conversion for input parameters

## Ex 09 ##

- Multiline string can be created using ' or "
- '\' is used for escape sequences in strings

## Ex 10 ##

- Python uses UTF-8 as default source encoding
- '\n' (Line feed) is newline convention for Unix systems, which is different from Windows
- Some interesting escape sequences:
    * '\a' : Bell
    * '\b' : Backsapce
    * '\r' : Carriage return
    * '\f' : Form feed
    * '\t' : Horizontal tab
    * '\v' : Vertical Tab
